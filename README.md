# Block-catcher

This project was created in a couple of hours, 
the reason for its creation was the disconnection of the Internet for a couple of days

Idknw why I decided to put this project on github, there is nothing 
special in the code, because I didn't even write the player movement myself, 
but used a ready-made solution from the asset store, inheriting some scripts
